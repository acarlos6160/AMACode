To Do:
1. Fix project text file reading (4 columns - name + prompt)
2. Show pop-up when player cannot expand department
3. Fix deletion of completed/failed projects on the GUI; code will not work for some reason.

Max Professors = 2(department lvl)
Max Postdocs = 4(department lvl)
Max Grad = 12(department lvl)

Professor ER = 10% - Grad ER/10 + Pride/5
Post doc ER = 20% + Pride/3
Grad ER = User-inputted

Postdoct number = (Post ER/43)*3
and Grad number = Grad ER(12)

For professor it's a base 10% chance to get one
and at pride 100 its 100/5 = 20
so the max chance to get a professor is 30%

tragedy occurs = 100K loss

$25,000, $50,000, $100,000 = easy, medium, hard
10, 20, 30 pride reward
2, 4, 8 pride loss

Easy Projects: $25K to start
Medium Projects: $50K to start
Hard Projects: $100K to start

Reward = Cost * 4
Penalty = Nothing

*** = Code with NUMBERS that you can alter to mess with the 'balance' of the game
### = Code I (we) have written; not the code that the machine generates for the GUI

PROJECT FORMAT
name category difficulty

2 professors per department
Each upgrade = +2 professors
Each upgrade costs double the previous

Projects
	1. Science
	2. Math
	3. Literature
	4. Humanities

Project Difficulty - Defense Rating (Probability to Succeed) 	*CAP AT 95%*
	1. Easy - 75%	Reward: School pride by +10%
	2. Medium - 50% Reward: School pride by +20%
	3. Hard - 25%	Reward: School pride by +30%

Faculty Members
	- "Spend" them to increase probability of success
		1. Professors add 100% to base success rate
		2. Post Doctorates add 50%
		3. Graduate Students add 25%

	- Professor can hold 2 post doctorates and 10 graduate students

Faculty Lifecycle
	1. Professors: Indefinity
	2. Post Doctorates: 4 turns
	3. Graduate Students: 8 turns

Objective
	1. Complete tasks

Reward
	1. Money - Spent to upgrade the department (More faculty)
	2. School Pride - Spent to increase chance of success per project, capped at 100

Mechanic
	1. Higher school pride, lower acceptance rate = Higher ranked faculty (more professors, less graduate students)
	2. Tragedy: Percentage for user to lose money or professors
		- School pride = 0, increase Tragedy by +50%
	3. More professors = higher chance project will succeed

TURN-BASED: 1 turn = 1 semester

GUI
	View and Adjust
		1. Department Levels
		2. Number of Staff
		3. Money
		4. School Pride
		5. Acceptance Rate


And the ability for the player to adjust the acceptance rate, select projects, assign faculty to them and spend school pride, and lastly spend money to upgrade the departments.
